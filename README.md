# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 This project utilized Kickstarter's database to practice data visualization techniques in Excel. Functions such as PivotTables, quartile calculation, countifs, and auto-generated charts were the key components of parsing through specific filters of data that may be useful to make predictions about similar campaigns.

### Purpose
By extrapolating data from a wide range of Kickstarter campaigns, I aim to assist the client, Louise, determine optimal characteristics of a successful campaign for a play. Ideally, with the data provided, the client will be better equipped to launch a successful campaign and meet their goal, achieving the funding necessary to realize their crowdfunded product.

## Analysis and Challenges
The primary analysis of the Kickstarter data was filtered under two specific lenses: Launch Date and Funding Goals. By cross-referencing these two filters of Kickstarter projects for plays, the aim is to provide the client with the ideal time to begin her crowdfunding project, based on the scale of their financial need.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By crossing the success of plays launched on Kickstarter, campaigns launched in May are the most successful of any other month, as is evidence in the chart below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
